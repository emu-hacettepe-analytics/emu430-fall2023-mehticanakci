In our project you will find clues from Turkey's prisons about convicts and their educational level. We want to explore whether education level has an effect on crime . Also we want to explore convicts educational level since 1990s.

"All our knowledge hast its origins in our perceptions ... In nature there is no effect without a cause ... Experience never errs; it is only your judgments that err by promising themselves effects such as are not caused by your experiments ... Science is the observation of things possible, whether present or past; prescience is the knowledge of things which may come to pass."― **Leonardo da Vinci**
